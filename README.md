# KinveyLiveServicesNativeScript
Sample project to test *Kinvey Live Services* on a **NativeScript** project.

In order to test *Kinvey Live Services* with this application you need to make sure that:

1. You have an application on _Kinvey Console_ with __Live Services turned on__;
2. You have a __Books__ collection on your Kinvey Application;
3. Open the `home.component.ts` of this project and make sure to add your `Application ID`, `Application Secret` and user name and password for a _Kinvey Application User_.
4. When you run the application, make sure to follow the logs on the console. They will
indicate the state of _Kinvey Live Services_. Each time you add a new entity to the __Kinvey Collection__, those messages
will appear on the console logs.
